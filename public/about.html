<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2> Dear Visitors,</h2>
<p>Welcome to my web developer portfolio! I am thrilled to have this opportunity to introduce myself and share my journey with you.
  My name is Pepe Rovira, and I am a passionate web developer currently in training. While my journey may not have begun in the field of technology, 
  I firmly believe that my diverse background brings a unique perspective to my work.
</p>

<p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics from the prestigious Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.
   This educational experience has provided me with a strong foundation in understanding market dynamics, analyzing consumer behavior,
   and making strategic decisions. These skills, which are crucial in the world of web development, allow me to approach projects with a holistic understanding of the economic implications and user experience.
  To further expand my knowledge and stay at the forefront of technology, I pursued a Master's degree in Blockchain and its business applications at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalun√±a. This program provided me with in-depth expertise in blockchain development, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. I understand the potential of this transformative technology and how it can enhance security, transparency, and efficiency across various industries.

<p>In my previous professional experience, I had the privilege of working as the Treasury Team Leader for the Americas continent at Nouryon chemicals. This role allowed me to hone my leadership, analytical, and problem-solving skills. Currently, I am excelling as a Site Payments Associate at Thermo Fisher, one of the largest Clinical Research Groups worldwide. This position has given me a keen eye for detail, the ability to work under pressure, and excellent time management skills.</p>
  
<p>  Combining my educational background in economics, expertise in blockchain technology, and professional experience in finance and clinical research, I bring a well-rounded skill set to the world of web development. I am enthusiastic about learning new technologies, programming languages, and frameworks to continually enhance my abilities in this ever-evolving field.
  I am confident that my strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and passion for web development will make me a valuable asset to any project. I am excited to embark on this journey and contribute to creating innovative, user-friendly, and visually appealing websites and applications.
  Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and bring your web development visions to life.</p>
